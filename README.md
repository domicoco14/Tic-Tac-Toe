# Tic-Tac-Toe

Dominion's Tic-Tac-Toe game — a small Python implementation of the classic 3x3 tic-tac-toe game.

## Features
- Two-player (local) gameplay in the terminal
- Simple, easy-to-read Python implementation

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+

## Installation
Clone the repository and run the game script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/domicoco14/Tic-Tac-Toe.git
cd Tic-Tac-Toe
# run the game (replace `main.py` with the actual script name if different)
python main.py
```

If the repository uses a different entrypoint file, run that file instead (for example `python tic_tac_toe.py`).

## Usage
- Players take turns entering moves when prompted.
- Input format depends on the script (row/column or single-number position). Follow the on-screen prompts.
